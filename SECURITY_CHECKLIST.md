# 🔒 Security Checklist Before Pushing to GitHub

## ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Removed hardcoded admin credentials from AuthContext.jsx
- [x] Updated .env.example with staff credential variables
- [x] Sanitized STAFF_LOGIN_README.md
- [x] Enhanced .gitignore files
- [x] Firebase config uses environment variables

## ⚠️ BEFORE YOU PUSH - VERIFY THESE:

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Create a `.env` file in the `client/` directory
- [ ] Add your actual Firebase configuration to `.env`
- [ ] Add your staff credentials to `.env`
- [ ] **NEVER** commit the `.env` file to GitHub

### 2. Double-Check No Secrets in Code
```bash
# Run these commands to scan for potential secrets:
grep -r "password.*=" client/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "api.*key.*=" client/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "secret.*=" client/src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### 3. Verify .gitignore
- [ ] Confirm `.env` is in .gitignore
- [ ] Confirm `node_modules` are ignored
- [ ] Test that sensitive files are ignored

### 4. Test Your App
- [ ] Test that the app works with environment variables
- [ ] Test staff login functionality
- [ ] Test Firebase connection

## 🚨 CRITICAL NOTES

1. **Never push your .env file** - it contains sensitive credentials
2. **Your staff email/password are now in environment variables** - much safer!
3. **Firebase config is secure** - using environment variables ✅
4. **Documentation is sanitized** - no hardcoded credentials ✅

## 📝 Next Steps After Pushing
1. Set up environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Configure Firebase security rules
3. Enable Firebase Authentication
4. Set up proper admin role management

## 🆘 If You Accidentally Push Secrets
1. **Immediately** change all passwords/API keys
2. Remove the commit with sensitive data
3. Force push the cleaned history
4. Rotate Firebase API keys if exposed
